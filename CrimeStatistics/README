Final Project
This assignment demonstrates your understanding of the concepts from the CMIS 141 class. This
homework consists of 1 programming assignment worth 25 points.
Before attempting this project, be sure you have completed all of the reading assignments, hands-on
labs, discussions, and assignments to date.

1. (25 points) Design a Java application that will read a file containing data related to the US.
Crime statistics from 1994-2013. The description of the file is shown below. The application
should provide statistical results on the data including:
    a. Population growth in percentages from each consecutive year (e.g. 1994-1995
    calculation is ((262803276 - 260327021)/260327021)*100 = 0.9512%, 1995-1996 would
    be ((265228572 - 262803276)/262803276)*100 = 0.9229%)
    b. Years where the maximum and minimum Murder rates occurred.
    c. Years where the maximum and minimum Robbery rates occurred.
    d. Total percentage change in Motor Vehicle Theft between the years 1998 and 2012.
    e. Two (2) additional crime statistics results you add to enhance the application
    functionality.

The following are some design criteria and specific requirements that need to be addressed:
    a. Use command line arguments to send in the name of the US Crime Data file.
    b. You are not allowed to modify the Crime.csv Statistic data file included in this
    assignment.
    c. Use arrays and Java classes to store the data. (Hint: You can and should create a
    USCrimeClass to store the fields. You can also have an Array of US Crime Objects.)
 *   d. Your design should include multiple classes to separate the functionality of the
    application.
    e. You should create separate methods for each of the required functionality. (e.g.
    getMaxMurderYear() will return the Year where the Murder rate was highest. )
 *   f. A user-friendly and well-organized menu should be used for users to select which data
    to return. A sample menu is shown in run example. You are free to enhance your design
    and you should add additional menu items and functionality.
    g. The menu system should be displayed at the command prompt, and continue to
    redisplay after results are returned or until Q is selected. If a user enters an invalid menu
    item, the system should redisplay the menu with a prompt asking them to enter a valid
    menu selection
    h. The application should keep track of the elapsed time (in seconds) between once the
    application starts and when the user quits the program. After the program is exited, the
    application should provide a prompt thanking the user for trying the US Crime Statistics
    program and providing the total time elapsed.
    Here is sample run: java TestUSCrime Crime.csv

Submission requirements:
Your deliverables include all Java files (.java) and a single word (or PDF) document. The Java files should
be named appropriately for your applications. Your word document should include screen shots
showing the successful compiling and running of each application, and a detailed description of the test
plan for each application. The test plan should include the input, expected output, actual output and if
the test case passed or failed. Submit your files to the Final Project assignment area no later than the
due date listed in the calendar.

US Crimes Data Description:
The attached Comma delimited file, named Crime.csv contains US Crime data from 1994 – 2013. The
first line in the file contains the field names. (Note: Do not modify this file in anyway. You should use it
as is for input for your application)
The US Crime data were obtained from this Web Site:

Ongoing:
- loop case one and return string in getter method
- setup the 20 and 21 value variables to read array length to determine value to make more dynamic and independent
- simplify some of the getter methods
- break out the static methods into reusable blocks
- Break out timer into own class with static method

Future:
- display in window
- use drop downs for options for users to determine what data they want and simplify questions
- setup system timeout for forgotten sessions
