(25 points) Write a Java program the displays the State bird and flower.
You should use your IDE for this exercise. You should also use Java
classes to their full extent to include multiple methods and at least
two classes. The program should prompt the user to enter a State and print
both the State bird and flower. The user should be able to enter a State
without worrying about case. (e.g. Users could enter Maryland, maryland,
MARYLAND or any other possible combination of lower and upper case characters.
States may also contain leading and trailing white spaces. Hint: Store the
State information in a multidimensional array. The program should continue to
prompt the user to enter a state until “None” is entered. You will need to do
some research to find the State birds and flowers. Here is a sample run:

    Enter a State or None to exit:
    Maryland
    Bird: Baltimore Oriole
    Flower: Black-eyed Susan
    Enter a State or None to exit:
    Delaware
    Bird: Blue Hen Chicken
    Flower: Peach Blossom
    Enter a State or None to exit:
    None

Your deliverables include all Java files (.java) and a single word (or PDF)
document. The Java files should be named appropriately for your applications.
Your word document should include screen captures showing the successful
compiling and running of each application, and a detailed description of the test
plan for each application. The screen captures should document your use of the IDE.
The test plan should include the input, expected output, actual output and if
the test case passed or failed. Submit your files to the Homework 4 assignment
area no later than the due date listed in the calendar.
