Create your own data file consisting of integer, double or String values.

Create your own unique Java application to read all data from the file echoing
the data to standard output. After all data has been read, display how many data
were read. For example, if 10 integers were read, the application should display
all 10 integers and at the end of the output, print "10 data values were read"
